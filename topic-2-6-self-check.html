					<h3>Scientific Revolution Self-Check</h3>
				</header>
				This section of the learning module is to create a space for you to stop and reflect on what you have learned.
				<br/>
				A few questions will be posed for you to consider. Think deeply about these questions and justify your answers.
				<br/>
				If you feel you do not have a strong understanding of your answer or why it is so, please take the time to go back 
				and revisit certain sub-topics to strengthen your understanding.
				<br/> 
			<div>
				REFLECTION PROMPTS:
				<br/><br/>
				1. In thinking about technology and it's role in Astronomy, what would you say has had the biggest impact? Why?
				 Would this technology be considered historical or current?
				<br/><br/>
				2. How has technology changed overtime in your own life? 
			   <br/><br/>
			    Do you feel these changes have been for the better or worse? Why?
			    <br/><br/>
			    3.  What does Science attempt to accomplish?
			    <br/><br/>
			    4. Can the Scientific Method be self-correcting? If not, why? If so, how?
			    <br/><br/>
			   	5. What is the role of Technology in our world? Do you think Technology is accomplishing what it should at a beneficial rate to humans and/or the environment?
