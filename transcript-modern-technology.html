		<p>The Scientific Method is a process of observations, questions, investigations, observations, data collections, and theory.<br/>
		These processes often do not occur in a particular order and it's path can be changed or re-visited according to what's needed.<br/>
		The Scientific Method is not fool proof and can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions, however since experiments are meant to be reproduced,<br/>
		this can also lead to corrections in procedure and theory.<br/></p>
