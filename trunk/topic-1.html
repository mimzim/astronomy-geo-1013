				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p> This astronomy module will provide an overview of astronomers, astronomy theories, and science and technology within this context.  
				Additionally, the module will take a closer look at the astronomy theories allowing you to benefit by actively engaging with the content.  
				This course is a multi-media rich experience, utilizing videos and animations and includes checks for understanding, a final assessment,
				and a certificate of completion.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Recognize how technology and science differ and how they support each other.
				<li>Identify and recall major astronomers and their contributions to science and technology.</li>
				<li>Consider theories of astronomy and how advancement of technology led to revision of theories.</li>
				<li>Identify past and present theories and laws of astronomy.</li>
				<li>Use Keplerâ€™s Laws to track planetary motion.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>				
				<h3>Navigating the Course</h3>
				<p>The course is made up of two main topics with subtopics under each heading.  Once you have completed a topic, the next topic becomes visible.  
				At the end of each main topic, there will be a self-check. If you miss the question, you may go back to the topics to review.  After the entire course 
				has been navigated, the final quiz will become available to take. If you receive a passing grade, you may save and print your certificate of completion.
