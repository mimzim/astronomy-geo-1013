				This learning module is designed for the UTSA Geology 1013- Astronomy course. The contents provide an overview of early astronomers, astronomy history and theory, science and technology.
			This learning module is a multimedia rich experience that included, animation, video and audio.  There are two main topics, Astronomical Revolution and Scientific Revolution with each 
			including several related sub-topics. After each topic there will be a self-check to help you monitor your learning and understanding of concepts discussed in this learning module
			and at the end is a comprehensive multiple choice assessment, when passed will provide you with a printable certificate of completion. You may begin your learning
			journey now by navigating the tabs above. Good luck and have fun!

				This page depicts a timeline showing when some of the most famous astronomers 1st influenced the world. Astronomy was experiencing extreme  
				breakthroughs during these times and developed as a legitimate branch of science. Not all theories were readily accepted and some caused 
				major turmoil with the church and state.

				You are now on the early astronomers page which provided valuable information about each astronomer.  Click on an astronomer's name to see 
				his picture and read the information provided. Now would be a good time to start taking notes since you will need to know names, dates and theories.

				Here you will learn about four different astronomy laws including geocentricity, retrograde, stellar parallax, and Kepler's laws. 
				Learning and understanding each law is extremely important. When you click on an astronomy law, you will be re-directed to an external source that
				helps enrich concepts with animation and additional information. You may revisit these sights any time and remember to take notes, as these pages are very information rich!

				Wonderful! You have now accessed the Astronomical Revolution Self-Check page. This is when the notes you have been taking come in handy! A drag and drop activity is provided you for to review and test your 
				knowledge of the Astronomical Revolution. If you are having difficulty matching the astronomer with the corresponding date, you should review the 
				information on the previous pages and then re-visit this page. It is important to have a strong understanding of these concepts as it will help you greatly in the comprehensive assessment at the end of this module.

				You have come to the 2nd main topic page, Scientific Revolution.  Scientific Revolution connects to several subtopics including: the scientific Method,
				 historical technology and modern technology.
				As with Astronomical Revolution, there will also be a self-check at the end where you can review what you have learned about this topic.
				 When you think of Science, 
				remember that it attempts to understand the natural world through observations and testing hypothesis.
				 Click on the video to watch a brief history about the Scientific Revolution, it is 
				full of interesting facts some of which might be very surprising to you!

				The Scientific Method is a process of observations, questions, investigations, observations, data collections, and theory. These processes often do 
				not occur in a particular order and it's path can be changed or re-visited according to what's needed.  The Scientific Method is not fool proof and can
				sometimes lead to wrong conclusions, however since experiments are meant to be reproduced, this can also lead to corrections in procedure and theory.

				Throughout history the development of technology has aimed to help make things easier and faster. Today many people think of technology related to electronic components like the
				Ipad, internet and robotics. However, even a pencil or a hammer can be considered as technology as they were created to make tasks easier and faster. Technology has produced the Industrial Era when 
				factories and machines replaced hard labor, 
				and most recently the Information Era,  where almost anything can be learned and seen by the touch of a button. Easier and faster has certainly taken on a whole new meaning.
