					<h1>ASTRONOMY THEORIES SELF CHECK</h1>
				</header>
				This section of the learning module is to create a space for you to stop and reflect on what you have learned.
				<br/>
				A few questions will be posed for you to consider. Think deeply about these questions and justify your answers.
				<br/>
				If you feel you do not have a strong understanding of your answer or why it is so, please take the time to go back 
				and revisit certain sub-topics to strengthen your understanding.
				<br/> 
				REFLECTION PROMPTS:
				<br/><br/>
				1. In thinking about technology and it's role in Astronomy, what would you say has had the biggest impact? Why?
				 Would this technology be considered historical or current?
				<br/><br/>
				2. How has technology changed overtime in your own life? 
			   <br/><br/>
			    Do you feel these changes have been for the better or worse? Why?
			    <br/><br/>
			    3.  What does Science attempt to accomplish?
			    <br/><br/>
			    4. Can the Scientific Method be self-correcting? If not, why? If so, how?
			    <br/><br/>
			   	5. What is the role of Technology in our world? Do you think Technology is accomplishing what it should at a beneficial rate to humans and/or the environmnet?
				<br/><br/>
				****BONUS**** Automobiles....What's your take on them? Sure they reduced horse-waste and subsequent diseases, allowed people to live and work away from cities
				and created wonderful mobility for all!!  However, considering the ozone damage now caused by vehicle emission, are cars still all that great???				<br/>			<br/>
				<br/>
