		<p>Here you will learn about four different astronomy laws including geocentricity, retrograde motion, stellar parallax, and Kepler's laws.<br/>
		Learning and understanding each law is extremely important. When you click on an astronomy law, you will be re-directed to an external source that<br/>
		helps enrich concepts with animation and additional information.<br/>
		You may revisit these sights any time and remember to take notes, as these pages are very information rich!<br/>
		<br/>
		Close this page to continue the learning module.</p>
